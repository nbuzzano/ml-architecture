Hi there!

Here you can find machine learning algorithms used and tested in this project. 

I would like to point out that this project is currently undergoing refactoring. That's why ML algorithms that can be found here, 
are being migrated to run on Airflow. Take a look to `/ source / dags / modeling` and enjoy the new ML algorithm as Airflow nodes.

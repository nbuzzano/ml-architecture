Here we have the last pipeline step.

We could make reports or update dashboards or whatever the business need is. I let this step be an open implementation as it is not the goal of the project to deal with business rules.

Probably the ML algorithm reports stored in `source / ml-reports /` would be useful for this task. Which can also be accessed via **mlflow ui**.

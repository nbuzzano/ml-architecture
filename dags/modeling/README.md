Hi there!

Here you can find all the machine learning algorithms used by Airflow. But I would like to point out that this project is currently undergoing refactoring. For that reason, in `/ source / predictions /` is the place where you can find all the ML algorithms tested since this project is alive. Only the Airflow integration is missing to be able to find them here.

So stay tuned for the upcoming releases to see them in action!
